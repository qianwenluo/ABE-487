Rising food prices and the increasingly mainstream local and organic food
movements are increasing the popularity of urban farming. While many of these
take place on ground level in vacant lots or appropriated parkland, existing
buildings provide a new frontier for growing food within the city. In
shrinking post-industrial cities, large swathes of buildings have been
abandoned that lend themselves to new uses as vertical urban farms. In denser
and growing cities, appropriating buildings that are structurally sound but no
longer useful for their intended purpose, or rooftops and balconies on
functioning buildings, can provide hyper-local food using a minimum of space.
